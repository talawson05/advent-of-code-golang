# Day 10

## Part 1

3 types on input per line, that'll be fun.
There's a note saying default values are off, that'll be important.
Ah, toggling switches on/off... great. There's going to be a lot of iterating isn't there.
Joltage can be safely ignored; yeah right. We'll see that in part 2.
Finally determine the fewest total toggles.
Sum the lot for the final answer.
And with 185 lines in the input, I'm not manually calculating it any time soon.

### Part 1 TDD

Test the input parsing first.
Test the toggling, where different buttons control one or more light, and it's state is maintained.
Create tests for the example input.
